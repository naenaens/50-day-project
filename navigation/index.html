        <small>Not sure if it's user friendly though</small>
        <p>
          Creating a website with user-friendly navigation is crucial for
          providing a positive experience to visitors. I've learned that clear
          menus and easily accessible links help users find what they need
          quickly and easily. However, I've realized that the project I'm
          currently working on isn't mobile-friendly. It lacks responsiveness,
          making it difficult for mobile users to navigate smoothly. Elements
          like small text and unresponsive buttons can frustrate visitors and
          drive them away. I understand the importance of optimizing the design
          for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience across all
          platforms. By prioritizing mobile responsiveness, I can improve
          usability and enhance the overall user experience.
